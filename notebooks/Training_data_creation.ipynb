    "Steps\n",
    "1. Extract points with reliable LU/LC classes from existing products. Use these 3 https://github.com/auspatious/ldn-lulc/blob/main/notebooks/Compare_LULC_per_class.ipynb. ESA Worldcover is the best one. Do this for Singaport or Suva, Fiji bounding box (due to presence of all classes hopefully). Classes should have roughly equal proportions in the sample points. Random sample all classes, use cluster method to reject outliers. This tells you which training points are more reliable.\n",
    "2. Align typologies/classes from those products to our classes defined here (level 1 only) https://github.com/auspatious/ldn-lulc/blob/8dd22d4190207c977c55e4cde9f236df6daf8722/typology/typology.md\n",
    "3. Extract the observational data (RGB and all other bands incl. geomad attributes), indices (NDVI, etc. TBC), DEM, etc.) This partially relies on geomad.\n",
    "4. Then iterate and tune the method to extract reliable training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output schema of training data: coordinates, crs, year, class, source of class e.g. \"ESA Worldcover\", RGB, all other bands, geomad properties, indices (e.g. NDVI), elevation."
